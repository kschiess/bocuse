module Bocuse

  # Bocuse would never use syntax sugar, but
  # instead uses syntax butter.
  #
  # Features that are about building the
  # hash are the core of bocuse.
  #
  # Features that are Chef related, are
  # bundled here.
  #
  # For example, the "cook" declaration,
  # application definitions, words like
  # "node", or "template" are found here.
